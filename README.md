# EnNote
EnNote combines "en" from the prefix meaning "to cause to be in" or "to put into,"
and "note," which refers to a written record or annotation. This name suggests the
act of securely entering and managing notes, aligning well with the app's purpose
of providing a secure space for users to access and manage their notes. The name
conveys a sense of security and organization, essential for a secure note app.
